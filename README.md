###   <h1 align="center">Credit Risk & Utilization Trends</h1>   

# Executive Summary

Analyzes credit portfolio data to examine the relationship between utilization, repayment behavior, and customer risk. Identifies high-exposure segments and regions, tracks delinquency concentration over time, and surfaces early risk signals that support targeted monitoring and informed portfolio decisions.

## 🎯 Main Business Questions & KPIs

### 1) Where is portfolio exposure concentrated?
**KPIs**
- Total Credit Limit
- Total Current Balance (Exposure)
- Exposure Share by Segment/Region (%)

### 2) Which customer groups show the highest emerging risk?
**KPIs**
- Delinquency Rate (by Segment/Region)
- Avg DPD (Days Past Due)
- High Utilization Share (% of accounts above a chosen threshold)

### 3) How does utilization relate to repayment behavior?
**KPIs**
- Balance-to-Limit Ratio (Utilization)
- Payment Ratio (Amount Paid / Amount Due)
- Delinquency Rate by Utilization Band

### 4) How does risk evolve across 2023?
**KPIs**
- Monthly Delinquency Trend
- DPD Bucket Mix by Month (On Time, 1–30, 31–60, 61+)
- Credit Score Trend by Segment

###   <h1 align="center"> Data Structure & ERD</h1> 

To improve data quality, performance, and analytical flexibility, the original Raw_Data table was normalized and split into Four separate tables:

* **customers** — Customer profiles, demographics, income
* **credit_accounts** — Account limits, balances, products
* **billing_payments** — Statements, payments, delinquency signals
* **bureau_monthly_snapshot** — Monthly scores, external risk signals

This structure makes analysis faster, cleaner, and BI-ready.

<h1 align="center">📊 Project Measures, KPIs & Calculated Fields</h1>

| KPI / Calc Field | Definition & Calculation |
|---|---|
| Utilization Rate % | Measures credit usage per account. **current_balance / credit_limit** from `credit_accounts`. |
| Delinquency Rate % | Share of late payments within a period. Computed from `billing_payments` using **DPD > 0**. |
| Average DPD | Average delay severity across accounts/portfolio. From `billing_payments`: **DATEDIFF(day, due_date, paid_date)** (or reference date if unpaid). |
| On-Time Payment Rate % | Percentage of payments made on or before due date. From `billing_payments`. |
| Exposure at Risk (EaR) | Total outstanding balance tied to delinquent accounts. **SUM(current_balance)** where **DPD > 0** using `credit_accounts` + `billing_payments`. |
| Credit Score Trend | Monthly direction of credit score movement (improving/deteriorating). From `bureau_monthly_snapshot`. |
| Payment Ratio | Measures repayment strength per statement. **amount_paid / amount_due** from `billing_payments`. |
| Balance-to-Income Ratio | Early stress indicator at customer level. **current_balance / income_monthly** using `credit_accounts` + `customers`. |
| High Utilization Flag | Risk marker for highly leveraged accounts. **CASE WHEN utilization >= 0.80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END**. |
| Score Band | Risk segmentation by credit score. Example bands: **Poor / Fair / Good / Very Good / Excellent** from `bureau_monthly_snapshot`. |
